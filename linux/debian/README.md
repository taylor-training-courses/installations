# Development Setup on Debian-family Distributions

Instructions are provided for those that prefer to do this themselves. The Debian-family includes Debian and any Linux distribution that is downstream of Debian - including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ElementaryOS, Zorin, and PopOS. Basically, if your distribution uses _apt_ or _aptitude_ as the main package manager - you are likely using a Debian-based distribution.

> Note: A user with __sudo__ is required for these instructions.

### Tested Ditributions and Versions

* Debian 11, 12, 13
* Ubuntu 22.x, 24.x
* Kubuntu 24.x, 25.x
* Linux Mint 21.x, 22.x

Should work with all recent versions of any Debian-family distributions.
